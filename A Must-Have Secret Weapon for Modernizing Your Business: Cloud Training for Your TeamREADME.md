# A Must-Have Secret Weapon for Modernizing Your Business: Cloud Training for Your Team

Teaching is the most effective approach I’ve discovered to overcome team members’ fear of the unknown. This is why I believe heads of training in organizations are dedicated to training and educating as many people as possible about cloud computing.
Many large and small businesses are exploring a move to cloud technology but are unsure how their teams can effectively use the technology for their operations. I think that investing in training to help create cloud capabilities inside your company is the unique approach to get the most out of your cloud investment. This allows you to use your existing team’s talents, achieve your business goals faster, and have confidence that your company is making the most of the cloud.
Stephen Orban wrote last year on the necessity of teaching current employees about the cloud. He stated that “everyone you need to move forward with the cloud is already there; all you have to do is empower them.”
Training may assist your personnel in using their existing core IT skills and institutional knowledge to move to cloud jobs. Because you won’t have to hire new personnel to fill cloud-based positions, training current employees saves you time and money.
Essentially, regardless of your cloud platform, the quicker you assess the jobs you now have and those you need, then invest in training to grow your workers, the easier your job will be.
Training allows you to achieve your company objectives more quickly.

Training your employees will enable them to use the cloud more effectively, allowing you to achieve your goals more quickly. Cloud training provides your staff with the knowledge they need to innovate more rapidly. Training is especially crucial for businesses going through difficult transitions.
Here are a few examples:

Your staff will benefit from training to learn how to use the cloud. They can, for example, learn how to use AWS to manage, run, and deploy applications efficiently.
By reducing your team’s fear by informing them about the unknown, you may increase internal buy-in. Training will provide your employees with a shared language, allowing them to collaborate more successfully.
Whether on AWS or another platform, a skilled workforce will be able to identify the services and solutions they require much faster, allowing you to build better solutions for your clients much more quickly.
Certifications and training are excellent ways to showcase your expertise.

Encourage employees to become certified so that everyone is confident in the team’s abilities. A core group of AWS Certified personnel can assist your business in navigating the shift and implementing best practices. Certification can assist you in identifying employees who are ready for advancement within your company. If your business does require additional cloud experience, search for certified individuals to cover any remaining gaps with assurance.
